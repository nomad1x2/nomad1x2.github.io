									<div class="box">
										<p>The recovered data indicates the APT is using a DNS server as a part of their operation. The triage team easily got the server running but it seems to reply to every request with errors.</p>
										
										<p>You decide to review past SIGINT reporting on the APT. Why might the APT be targeting the Guardian Armaments JCTV firmware developers? Reporting suggests the APT has a history of procuring information including the location and movement of military personnel.</p>
										
										<p>Just then, your boss forwards you the latest status update from Barry at GA. They found code modifications which suggest additional DNS packets are being sent via the satellite modem. Those packets probably have location data encoded in them and would be sent to the APT.</p>
										
										<p>This has serious implications for national security! GA is already working on a patch for the firmware, but the infected version has been deployed for months on many vehicles.</p>
										
										<p>The Director of the NSA (DIRNSA) will have to brief the President on an issue this important. DIRNSA will want options for how we can mitigate the damage.</p>
										
										<p>If you can figure out how the DNS server really works maybe we will have a chance of disrupting the operation.</p>
										
										<p><b>Find an example of a domain name (ie. foo.example.com.) that the DNS server will handle and respond with NOERROR and at least 1 answer.</b></p>

									<h3>Solving the task:</h3>
									
									<p>This one stumped me almost as long as task 3 did, but it became my favorite task by far.</p>
									
									<p>As we saw from the previous task, we end up with three files from the USB:</p>
									
									<li><b>Coredns</b> - which is a stripped <a href="https://coredns.io/">Coredns</a> binary written in Go</li>

									<li><b>Corefile</b> - the Coredns config file</li>

									<li><b>microservice</b> - another stripped binary (referencing JS, so assumed JS)</li>
									<br>
									<p>The makeup of the Corefile gives us a very specific regex that we are going for:</p>
									
<!-- Code emulation -->	
<div class="box">						
<h4>Corefile:</h4>
<pre><code class="language-go">.:1053 {
  acl {
    allow type A
    filter
  }
  view firewall {
    expr type() == 'A' && name() matches '^x[^.]{62}\\.x[^.]{62}\\.x[^.]{62}\\.net-zghn2ybn\\.example\\.com\\.$'
  }
  log
  cache 3600
  errors
  frontend
}
</pre></code>
</div>
									
									<p>From my research, I found that Coredns uses a chain of 'plugins' and loads the <a href="https://coredns.io/2017/07/23/corefile-explained/">Corefile</a> for its configuration which includes those plugins. Based on the task and the Corefile, we are looking for a domain that is of <a href="https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/a-record/#whats-an-a-record">record type A</a>, provides a <a href="https://bluecatnetworks.com/blog/the-top-four-dns-response-codes-and-what-they-mean/">NOERROR</a> response, <b>and</b> matches this regex:<br><br><b>x[62 characters].x[62 characters].x[62 characters].net-zghn2ybn.example.com.</b></p>
									
									<p>Seems straight forward: find the domain -- but what is that microservice?.. We'll get back to that.</p>
									
									<p>From my CoreDNS research, I also found that there is a <a href="https://coredns.io/plugins/debug/">debug</a> plugin that gives more logging details (similar to Task 3's loglevel). I just needed to add it to the Corefile, run the DNS server, and then generate a DNS query:</p>

									<p>Here we get some pretty interesting data. The error we get in the CoreDNS log is <b>bad name: illegal base32 data at input byte 22</b>. The DNS server looks like it combines each subdomain into one string, and (with some trial and error) removes the <b>.'s, W's, X's, Y's, and top-level</b> and also <b>turns Z's into ='s</b>. With some more research, I found that this isn't traditional Base32 encoding, but instead <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648.html#section-7">Base32 encoding with extended hex alphabet</a>, which is mainly used with DNS (go figure).</p>
									
									<p>I then found a <a href="https://cryptii.com/pipes/base32-to-hex">site</a> that does online RFC 4648 encoding and encoded this string to Base32Hex: <b>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789</b> which gave this encoding: <b>C5H66P35CPJMGQBADDM6QRJFE1ON4SRKELR7EU3PF8O32CHJ6GQJCDPO74======</b>.</p>
									
									<p>The next step was to query the DNS server once more and record the results -- but this time, I removed the length requirements by removing the entire <b>view firewall</b> block. Through more trial and error, I found out that the domain still needed to be three parts separated by '.x' while also changing the '=' to 'z'. Here is the new query followed by the results:</p>

									<p>Here we can see even more interesting data, which helped me understand even more about this DNS server: <b>the Base32Hex encoded string is some kind of encrypted data handshake</b>, identified by the <b>bad decrypt: bad handshake</b> line. Unfortunately this was the end of the road for the CoreDNS server at this point in time -- I wasn't too familiar with stripped Golang binaries and hit a breaking point. So I started looking at the microservice. (again, don't mind the timestamps... was a little late getting to the writeups):</p>

									<p>There are a few things to note based on the mongodb logs:</p>
									<li>The microservice connected to MongoDB from 127.0.0.1 using Node.js 6.8.0</li>
									<li>The microservice is running on port 3000</li>
									<li>The microservice performs a 'maintenance' task exactly 5 minutes after initialization</li>
									<br>
									<p>I did some more research into port 3000, and dug deeper into the binary to find that the microservice was also running <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a>. From here, I was able to locate the webserver's routes (/event/insert and /event/test), which confirmed my gut instincts above.</p>
									
									<p>We were dealing with a form of <a href="https://www.dnsfilter.com/blog/dns-tunneling-malware">DNS tunneling</a> where the APT seemed to be sending GPS data via DNS packets from the vehicle's modem. These DNS packets appeared to be (in theory at the time) sent to our DNS server, which then sent traffic to the microservice, which ultimately stored our vehicle location in a MongoDB server.</p>
									
									<p>At this point, I would dissect the microservice even further to get it to successfully interact with the MongoDB server. I found exactly what data we needed to send the microservice (at localhost:3000) in order to send the location data to the MongoDB server.</p>
									
									<p>Because that was the 75% of Task 7 I mentioned earlier, I'll leave out the extra steps in this task. After I figured out the microservice, it was a struggle to find the next step. I was lost in the sauce like a calculator kid trying to do mental math.</p>
									
									<p>I took a week off from working on the challenge and allowed my brain to recoup any of the neurons I had left. I finally started looking into reverse engineering stripped binaries and found <a href="https://cujo.com/blog/reverse-engineering-go-binaries-with-ghidra/">this</a> amazing stripped Golang blog post which included a <a href="https://github.com/getCUJO/ThreatIntel/tree/master/Scripts/Ghidra">link</a> to some of their stripped Golang recovery scripts. This is how I was able to find a small detail in Ghidra that led me down the correct path.</p>
									
									<p>I tried to run the <a href="https://github.com/getCUJO/ThreatIntel/blob/master/Scripts/Ghidra/go_func.py">go_func.py</a> script to recover function names but kept getting an error that <b>no .gopclntab section was found</b>, yet I could clearly see in the Program Tree that the section was in fact there. I also found that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures">magic numbers</a> were that of <a href="https://go.dev/src/debug/gosym/pclntab.go">Golang 1.20 (line 181 -- 0xfffffff1)</a>:</p>
									
									<div class="box">
										<div style="text-align: center;">
											<span class="image object">
												<img src="../../images/ghidra_pclntab.png" alt="" width="auto" class="other-img"/>
											</span>
										</div>
									</div>
									
									<p>Something felt off… I stared at it for a while, and then it hit me -- it had been right in front of me the whole time. The <b>.gopclntab</b> section <em>WAS</em> there, but with a sneaky typo: <b>.gopc1ntab</b>. That tiny swap -- an "l" turned into a "1" -- was enough to throw everything off; Another facepalming moment.</p>

									<p>So, I needed to modify the go_func.py script by changing the name of the section to <b>.gopc1ntab</b> and to also treat the identified magic number (<b>0xfffffff1</b>) as Golang 1.18 (used for 1.18 and above):</p>
									
									<p><em>Note: I also got rid of the unecessary lines in the code to clean up what I was working with.</em></p>
